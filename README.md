# CRC_TCell_Analysis

## Description
This repository contains the code for analyzing colorectal cancer T-cell data using Seurat and ggplot2. The analysis includes visualization and comparison of different conditions and T-cell annotations.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
To use this project, you need to have R and the following R packages installed:

```R
install.packages(c("Seurat", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```

### Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kreatorkat2004/CRC_TCell_Analysis.git
cd CRC_TCell_Analysis
```

### Executing program
To run the main analysis script, open R and execute the following command:

```R
source("scripts/analysis.R")
```

This will load the necessary datasets, preprocess the data, and generate the plots.
